## todo

### shit that's not directly related to scungus&colon;

#### figure out how to actually replace the cra presets

#### [babel-preset-dawnie](packages/babel-preset-dawnie/README.md)

#### rewrite so it's more tuned to my needs

- ~~remove the flow thing~~ maybe not remove that flow thing? it's a static type checker,
  tho it might need some fucking w/ to make it work
- change it so that typescript is absolute
- make it default accept ES Modules *instead* of CommonJS Modules
- fix the `(type: string | undefined)` issue in [index.mjs](./packages/babel-preset-dawnie/index.mjs)

##### additional nodes&colon;

corejs version is 3.26.1
