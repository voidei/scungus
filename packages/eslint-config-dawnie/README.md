### Credits

This [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) preset was created using the [eslint-config-react-app]<<https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/eslint-config-react-app#README.md>) from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
All rights reserved to [Facebook](https://github.com/facebook/) for any content explicitly created by them.
This further extends to any content that has only been lightly modified (i.e. typos, single word additions), in addition to functions, constants, or other elements of code, that have been modified only to change the output format (i.e. CommonJS Module to ES Module) without significantly changing, removing, or otherwise editing the function to be explicitly different from the original.
